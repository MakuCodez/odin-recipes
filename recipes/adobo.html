        <h2>This is the classic Filipino dish that we all love.</h2>
        <p>Adobo has its roots in prehistoric times. Vinegar was used by early cooks to store and preserve meat before cooling and refrigeration were available. While this concept was used by indigenous 
            people around the world, the Spanish were the people to call it “adobo.”  </p>
    
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

                <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet;

                    Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender
